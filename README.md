# Fortress

Fortress is a small project which demonstrate how to use Jetpack Compose and other latest Android libraries. The architecture used in Fortress is the well known MVVM.

<br/><br/>Current, the delete and search buttons are not working. I would complete the implementationn once I'm free.

<br/><br/>Some libraries used in the project include but not limited to:

- Coil - For loading images
- Android Biometric
- Ktx Navigation
- Retrofit - For network calls
- Hilt - For dependency injection
- Espresso - For Instrumentation testing
- JUnit - For both UI and Local tests
- Jetpack Compose - For Compose UI

I'm using the `buildSrc` for dependency management. I know, I know, it's not a multi-module project yet.
